# Setup
To use this header file, you can include it in your `C++` codes by 2 methods:
## Add Header file to include folder
Copy the header file to the include folder of your compiler/IDE. This shall allow the the header file to be used as any other header file.

For Dev-Cpp the location of the include folder is:
`"[Installation Location]\MinGW64\include"`

To include the header file:

````
#include <lexicon.h>
````

## Give location of the header file
Use a slightly differnt `#include` directive to include the header file by giving its absolute or relative location to the cpp file

To include header file:

_Assuming that_
- _Location in which `cpp` file is saved: `C:\Code\test.cpp`_
- _Location in which header file is saved: `C:\File\lexicon.h`_

````
#include "C:/File/lexicon.h"
// This uses the absolute location of the file
// recommended only if the file shall never be moved
````

__OR__

````
#include "../File/lexicon.h"
// This uses the relative location of the header file
// Recommended of the header file and the cpp code will be moved/copied
// Also copy the files/folder together
````
